# Self-Organizing-Maps
  
  In this repository I have written the code for Self Organizing Maps with a lot of tunable paramters like Learning Rate decay,
  decay of neighbourhood functions over time, all implemented with differnt functions, with the ability to easily insert a new
  function by the user. Currently this is only 2D with 1D maps being input as a 2D tuple [n, 1] for n nodes.
